# The Oko Product

Oko Haptics developed a pair of stereo vision smartglasses, which is coupled with a haptic belt. The device provides users with directional vibrotactile feedback, using optical stimuli, captured and processed by the on-board computer vision system.

## Recognition

Oko Haptics received the [Baylis Medical Capstone Design Award 2019](https://uwaterloo.ca/capstone-design/baylis-medical-capstone-design-awards)
