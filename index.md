## System Capabilities

* Stereo vision depth mapping of a user's environment in a 60° x 50° (horizontal x vertical) field of view
* Wall and floor detection using dynamic thresholding of real time image streams
* Wireless smartglasses-belt interface
* 10Hz feedback refresh rate
* Processor heat load dissipation to sustain device surface temperatures below 30°C

## Recognition

Oko Haptics received the [Baylis Medical Capstone Design Award 2019](https://uwaterloo.ca/capstone-design/baylis-medical-capstone-design-awards)
